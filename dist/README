The files in these folders are meant to be portable binaries for feff8l and
feff6l. The intention is that binaries for Linux, Windows, and Darwin (64
bit only) will be provided and that the contents of the folders
   linux64
   win64
   darwin64

should contain complete and working versions of Feff8 and Feff6l.
Note that the feff8l.py script is written in python nad will need a
python interpreter to run.  This script can run selected modules from
the set of feff8l executables.  Alternatively, a feff8l shell script
(and, for Windows, feff8l.bat batch script) file is provided that will
run all of the Feff8l modules in order.
