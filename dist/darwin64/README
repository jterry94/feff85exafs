These binaries for Feff8l and Feff6l were built on MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina) using
gcc and gfortran from gcc 10.2, from Homebrew.  They will work only for X86_64.

The makedist.sh script was used to copy the shared libraries for libgcc_s,
libquadmath, and libgfortran.  The `install_name_tool` utility from Xcode
was used to point the feff executables and libraries to the local versions
of these libraries in the current folder.

That is, the files in this folder should be portable to any supported macOS
machine (possibly earlier than 10.14, but not tested).
