These binaries for Feff8l and Feff6l were built on Centos 7.8.2003 using 
gcc and gfortran from gcc 4.9.2 and glibc 2.17.  

   ~> gcc -v 
   Using built-in specs.
   COLLECT_GCC=gcc
   COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/local/libexec/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.9.2/lto-wrapper
   Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   Configured with: ./configure --disable-multilib --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran
   Thread model: posix
   gcc version 4.9.2 (GCC) 

The makedist.sh script was used to copy the shared libraries for
libgcc_s, libquadmath, and libgfortran from gcc 4.9.2 to this folder,
then rename to have '_f8' in their names to distinguish from local
system library files for gcc, gfortran, etc.  The patchelf utility is
then used to modify all of the shared libraries and executables to use
thes '_f8' libraries.

The shared libraries and executables will depend on libc.so, libm.so
from glibc, and also on the linux x86_64 libraries linux-vdso.so.1 and
/lib64/ld-linux-x86_64.so.2.  These binaries should work on any system
built with glibc 2.17 or higher.  This version of glibc was released
in 2012, and so should work with:
 
   Debian 8  or higher
   Centos 7  or higher
   Ubuntu 14 or higher
   Fedora 20 or higher
